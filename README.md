Valheim is a game developed by https://irongate.se/<br/>

# Valheim Description
Valheim is a survival type of game, food plays an important role in the player's survivability.<br/>
<br/>
# Intro
<p>Most people who play Valheim start by creating a new player, and then a new world that is based on a
randomly generated "seed" that is provided by the game. The seed basically defines what the resulting world
will be like, the topography, environments (biomes), and spawn points of items and mobs (monsters) in the game.
</p>
<p>After playing for quite a while, a player may decide that they are not fond of the seed (world) that they started
with. They perhaps learn from watching videos online and searching forums that there are better seeds (worlds).
</p>
<p>After searching for some time for the "seeds" that were shared online, and examining what they look like, I decided
that this seed is the one that I think is best: <b>WBFzViM6sG</b>
</p>
<p>
I just found the original video where I first discovered the above seed.

<p>When I created a new world using this seed, I was hesitant to switch to it as my main world at first. I had invested so much
time creating buildings and fortifications in my original map that it was a hard thing for me to switch.
I decided that I would start gradually by creating the initial base and fortifying it. Then I proceeded to explore and
create other bases. Now I have created bases in the Meadows and Black Forest biomes that exist in key strategic places
accross the world.
</p>
<p>I started to wonder if other players who have invested considerable time into a world, would be more willing to switch to
a new world if it had been set up like I have done in this case.
</p>
<p>This world was created between November 2024 and January 28, 2025. Ashlands and it's boss, Fader, exists on this map. You
will have to explore and create your own bases in any new biomes (i.e. Deep North) that are released by irongate.se in the
future. A word of caution, research indicates that if you build in an area that irongate.se has not finished developing, your
bases/forts/changes may be wiped out after a game update that releases content for that new biome. I left a small shack,
NORTHBED, with a portal close to the Deep North for your convenience when that biome is finally released.
</p>

# Main Details
<p>At the time of creating this world, that I have zipped up and shared here, I was a Black Forest level player. So, the
technologies that I used while creating all of the buildings and their fortifications are only what would be available to
a Black Forest level character.
</p>
<p>Additionally, I noticed that the bosses that I had defeated on the first world are not carried over to this new world.
That means that when you switch to this world, you will only be seeing the raids that would be appropriate to a new
player, and you will need to kill any bosses that you had already killed elsewhere on this world again.
For further clarification, the "world save files" remembers the bosses that were killed, I have not killed any on this new world yet.
</p>
<p>I found locations near each biome, i.e. Swamp, Mountains, Plains etc., that had a boss spawn for that biome, and that had
either Meadows or Black Forest biomes near by, and I have built forts in those nearby Meadows and Black Forest biomes to
make progression to the next biome and locating it's boss easier. You will still need to locate exactly where the boss spawns
are in the appropriate biomes that are located near the forts that I bulit, so I wouldn't consider this to be a "cheat", but
a simple time saver.
</p>
<p>I have also placed forts in locations that are within a reasonable distance of all the varoius Traders.
They should not be hard for you to find
</p>
<p>Each of these forts have Portals back to the Starting (spawn) location (fort).
</p>
<p>I tested this world with a new character and vanilla Valheim, i.e. no mods, and it loaded and played fine.
I don't forsee you having any issues using it whether you use mods or not.
</p>
<p>In order to use this world you will need to download the zip file and extract it. You will then need to place the contained
files into your saves area for Valhiem worlds on your computer. You can typically find this in:</p>
<p><b>C:\Users\username\AppData\LocalLow\IronGate\Valheim\worlds_local\ </b>
</p>
<p>Replace "username" above with your user's name. If you have trouble with this, search the web for help, there are
several websites that provide detailed information on this process for sharing Valheim worlds.
</p>
<p>If you happen to find a bed that belongs to someone else, delete it and build it again so that you can claim it with
your character.
</p>
<p>I left the materials for a boat (Karve) in a chest on the dock of the spawn (starting) area. I also left an assembled Karve at the
SOUTHFORT location, but, I don't recommend going to SOUTHFORT or sailing from there if you are a new player.
</p>

# Summary
<p>These world save files would probably be most appreaciated by someone who has already played Valheim for a while and who
wants to try starting over on a new world seed. If you are already past the Black Forest level of player, you may
want to replace the buildings and/or fortifications with more advanced techniques and materials, but you should still find
the navigation via portals to each of the areas would have some value to you.
</p>
<p>Of course if you want the original experience of Valheim (i.e. without my help), you will most likely still appreciate
starting out from scratch with the seed that I indicated above, mentioned here again for your convenience... WBFzViM6sG.
</p>
<p>You are welcome to use this world for individual or multiplayer use as well as to share it and/or alter as you like.
</p>
<p>Enjoy!
