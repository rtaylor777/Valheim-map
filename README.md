# Valheim Description
Valheim is a survival type of game, food plays an important role in the player's survivability.<br/>
<br/>
# Intro
Most people who play Valheim start by creating a new player, and then a new world that is based on a<br/>
randomly generated "seed" that is provided by the game. The seed basically defines what the resulting world<br />
will be like, the topography, environments (biomes) and spawn points of items and mobs (monsters) in the game.<br />
<br />
After playing for quite a while, a player may decide that they are not fond of the seed (world) that they started<br />
with. They perhaps pick up from watching videos online and searching forums that there are better seeds (worlds).<br />
<br />
After searching for some time the "seeds" that were shared online and examining what they look like I decided<br/>
that this seed is the one that I think is best: <b>WBFzViM6sG</b><br/>
