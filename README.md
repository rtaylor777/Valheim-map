# Valheim Description
Valheim is a survival type of game, food plays an important role in the player's survivability.<br/>
<br/>
# Intro
Most people who play Valheim start by creating a new player, and then a new world that is based on a<br/>
randomly generated "seed" that is provided by the game. The seed basically defines what the resulting world<br />
will be like, the topography, environments (biomes) and spawn points of items and mobs (monsters) in the game.<br />
<br />
After playing for quite a while, a player may decide that they are not fond of the seed (world) that they started<br />
with. They perhaps pick up from watching videos online and searching forums that there are better seeds (worlds).<br />
<br />
After searching for some time for the "seeds" that were shared online, and examining what they look like I decided<br/>
that this seed is the one that I think is best: <b>WBFzViM6sG</b><br/>
<br/>
When I created a new world using this seed, I was hesitant to switch to it as my main world. I had invested so much<br />
time creating buildings and fortifications in my original map that it was a hard thing for me to switch.<br />
I decided that I would start gradually by creating the initial base and fortifying it. Then I proceeded to explore and<br />
create other bases. Now I have created bases in the meadows and black forest biomes that exist in key strategic places<br />
accross the world.<br />
<br/>
I started to wonder if other players who have invested considerable time into a world, would be more willing to switch to<br/>
a new world if it had been set up like I have done in this case.<br/>
<br/>
# Main Details
At the time of creating this world, that I have zipped up and shared here, I was a Black Forest level player. So, the <br/>
technologies that I used while creating all the buildings and their fortifications are only what would be available to<br/>
a Black Forest level character.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, I noticed that the bosses that I had defeated on the first world are not carried over to this new world.<br/>
That means that when you switch to this world, you will only be seeing the raids that would be appropriate to a new<br/>
player, and you will need to kill any bosses that you had already killed elsewhere on this world again.<br/>
For further clarification, the world save remembers the bosses that were killed, I have not killed any on this new world yet.<br/>
<br/>
I found locations near each biome, i.e. Swamp, Mountains, Plains etc., that had a boss spawn for that biome, that had<br/>
either Meadows or Black Forest biomes near by and I have built forts in those attached Meadows and Black Forest biomes to<br/>
make progression to the next biome and locating it's boss easier.<br/>
I have also placed forts in locations that are within a reasonable distance of all the varoius Traders.<br/>
<br/>
Each of these forts have Portals back to the Starting (spawn) location (fort).<br/>
<br/>
In order to use this world you will need to download the zip file and extract it. You will then need to place the contained<br/>
files into your saves area for Valhiem on your computer. You can typically find this in:<br/>
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\LocalLow\IronGate\Valheim\<br/>
Replace "<username>" above with your user's name. If you have trouble with this, search the web for help, there are<br/>
several websites that provide detailed information on this process for sharing Valheim worlds.<br/>
<br/>
# Summary
This world save would probably be most appreaciated by someone who has already played Valheim for a while and who<br/>
wants to try starting over on a new world seed. If you are already past the Black Forest level of player, you may<br/>
want to replace the buildings and/or fortifications with more advanced techniques and materials. But you should still find<br/>
the navigation via portals to each of the areas would have some value to you.<br/>
Of course if you want the original experience of Valheim, you will most likely still appreciate starting<br/>
out with the seed that I indicated above, WBFzViM6sG.<br/>
<br/>
You are welcome to use this world for individual or multiplayer use as well as to share it and/or alter as you like.<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
